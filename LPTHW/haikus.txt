I wake, reluctant; 
Too cold to get out of bed 
But I need to pee

Fat man sees small door 
He knows he cannot fit through 
Tears flow free now

A Hypotenuse 
Is on the opposite side 
Of the right angle

Haikus are easy 
But sometimes they don't make sense 
Refrigerator

A white plastic fork 
Met 3 silver spoons last night 
Stuck-up spoons are dumb
