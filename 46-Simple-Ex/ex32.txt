"Dammit I'm Mad"

Dammit I’m mad.
	This is a 224-word palindrome poem
Evil is a deed as I live.
	By Demetri Martin
God, am I reviled? I rise, my bed on a sun, I melt.
	With some random lines inserted in between
To be not one man emanating is sad. I piss.
	So that I can test
Alas, it is so late. Who stops to help?
	Does my I/O palindrome python program really work?
Man, it is hot. I’m in it. I tell.
	Or is it just going to not work.
I am not a devil. I level “Mad Dog”.
	And be buggy.
Ah, say burning is, as a deified gulp,
	Oh buggies.
In my halo of a mired rum tin.
	How irksome it is to dig you out.
I erase many men. Oh, to be man, a sin.
	But like a child I somewhat revel in it.
Is evil in a clam? In a trap?
	Sticking my fingers in the mud of clotted code.
No. It is open. On it I was stuck.
	Wiggling them about, searching.
Rats peed on hope. Elsewhere dips a web.
	Typing some random solutions.
Be still if I fill its ebb.
	Adding more bugs to the mix.
Ew, a spider… eh?
	Then simplifying.
We sleep. Oh no!
	And crazy as it is,
Deep, stark cuts saw it in one position.
	I find this fun!
Part animal, can I live? Sin is a name.
	Fun without the sun.
Both, one… my names are in it.
	Alright am I almost done?
Murder? I’m a fool.
	Just a few more lines.
A hymn I plug, deified as a sign in ruby ash,
	So while I can't match Martin in poetic quality
A Goddam level I lived at.
	I can meet him in poetic quantity
On mail let it in. I’m it.
	Is this a poem?
Oh, sit in ample hot spots. Oh wet!
	Or am I just bored at home?
A loss it is alas (sip). I’d assign it a name.
	Perhaps this distracts me from the fact that I'm home alone?
Name not one bottle minus an ode by me:
	No, I'm not alone.
“Sir, I deliver. I’m a dog”
	My zoo surrounds me.
Evil is a deed as I live.
	And I hope this works.
Dammit I’m mad.
	Because I'm good without bugs.
	RACECAR!
